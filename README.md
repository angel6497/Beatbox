# Beatbox

This repository contains one class which implements a GUI that allows the user to create a 16 interval musical beat using 16 different intruments. The GUI has a 16x16 grid of checkboxes where the user can input any pattern of time intervals and instruments. Once the pattern is set, the beat can be played. The class also lets the user save and load certain beats  through serialization, and change the tempo of the track.
